# WSCKR.com

This is the official respository for http://wsckr.com . It currently uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it is where I keep all of my small web JS projects. I'm not sure why you'd want to use this, this repo is just here to store files.

## Disclaimer

If you copy all of my code, then that means you aren't a real developer, and you can't show off to your friends without thinking that. The point is so you can look at it, and then figure it out yourself, not copying others.

## How to use

Well, usually I make node.js apps so I don't really know what to put here, other than go to the link I will post at the very bottom. Actually setting up the website, buying a domain and buying a server, as well as setting up said server and putting files on it is way too complicated for my liking.

## Special thanks

Kaynooo#0904 on Discord because they inspired me to get back into JavaScript (my main language) and improve at it.
